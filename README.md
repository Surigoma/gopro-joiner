# GoPro Joiner

[日本語](README.ja.md)

GoPro Joiner turns the chapter files created by a GoPro into one MP4 per recording. It keeps the original video and audio streams without re-encoding and preserves GoPro GPMF telemetry used by tools such as Gyroflow.

See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for release history.

## Highlights

- Automatically finds and orders chapters from the same recording.
- Joins multiple chapters without reducing video or audio quality.
- Preserves and verifies GPMF data, including gyroscope, accelerometer, and GPS metadata.
- Copies a single-file recording byte-for-byte instead of remuxing it.
- Processes independent recordings in parallel.
- Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Install and launch

GoPro Joiner is distributed as a portable application. Download the package for your operating system from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Surigoma/gopro-joiner/releases), verify it with `SHA256SUMS.txt`, extract it, and keep every file in the extracted directory together.

- Windows: launch `GoPro Joiner.exe` inside `GoProJoiner-win32-x64`.
- macOS: launch `GoPro Joiner.app`.
- Linux: launch `gopro-joiner` inside `GoProJoiner-linux-x64`.

On first use, open **Settings** and select **Download verified tools**. GoPro Joiner downloads pinned standalone FFmpeg and ffprobe binaries, verifies their size and SHA-256 hash, and stores them in the application's managed data directory. An internet connection is needed for this download; video processing itself is local.

## Quick start

1. Open **Settings** and choose your language and output preferences.
2. Download the verified media tools if they are not already available.
3. Return to **Convert** and select the directory containing your GoPro MP4 files.
4. Select an output directory.
5. Select **Scan folder**.
6. Review the detected captures. Only captures marked **Ready** are processed automatically.
7. Select **Start** and keep the application open until processing finishes.

The activity log reports completed files, warnings, skipped files, and failures. When JSON reporting is enabled, a detailed report is also written to the output directory.

## Your source videos are protected

GoPro Joiner is designed never to modify, move, or delete input videos.

- Existing output files are not silently overwritten; a numbered name is chosen instead.
- Work is written to a temporary file and finalized only after verification succeeds.
- Video and audio are stream-copied, not decoded and re-encoded.
- A one-file capture is copied without media processing.
- Output with unverifiable GPMF preservation is not reported as successful.
- Cancelling does not delete files that already completed.

Videos stay on your computer. The application does not upload them to a cloud service.

## Main settings

| Setting | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Filename format | Builds names with `{YYYY}`, `{MM}`, `{DD}`, `{hh}`, `{mm}`, `{ss}`, and `{NAME}` |
| Preserve input subfolders | Recreates the input directory structure below the output directory |
| Create folders by capture date | Groups output using `{YYYY}`, `{MM}`, and `{DD}` |
| Copy source videos | Copies source chapters into the date directory's `original` folder |
| JSON report | Writes a machine-readable processing report |
| Include subfolders | Scans directories below the selected input directory |
| Strict SHA-256 verification | Verifies byte-for-byte copies with SHA-256 |
| Concurrent capture groups | Limits parallel processing; leave blank for automatic selection |

Use **Restore defaults** to reset the language and conversion settings. Saved input and output directory selections are retained.

## Output behavior

- The default filename is similar to `2026-08-09_143052_GX012345.mp4`.
- Date directories use `2026-08-09` by default.
- A capture containing multiple compatible chapters is joined into one MP4.
- A capture containing one file is copied unchanged.
- Incompatible, incomplete, ambiguous, non-GoPro, or unreadable input is skipped or failed with a reason rather than converted automatically.

## Current limitations

- The application does not convert between H.264 and H.265 or change resolution, frame rate, bitrate, or HDR properties.
- It does not provide trimming, timeline editing, preview, stabilization, cloud upload, or 360-degree stitching.
- Stream-incompatible chapters fail instead of falling back to re-encoding.
- Real GoPro footage has passed packet-level video, audio, and `gpmd` verification, but every GoPro model and recording mode has not yet been validated.
- The project is currently an MVP. Treat irreplaceable footage as valuable source material and keep an independent backup.

## Building from source

Development requires Node.js 24, Corepack, Yarn 4.17.1, Go 1.26, and Task 3.x.

```powershell
go install github.com/go-task/task/v3/cmd/task@v3.51.1
task install
task install:electron
task dev
```

See the [product specification](docs/SPECIFICATION.md) for implementation details and safety requirements.
